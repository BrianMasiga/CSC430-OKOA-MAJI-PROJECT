Water is a finite resource that is essential to life, and its responsible usage has become a critical issue in many parts of the world. As populations grow and urbanization increases, the demand for water is also rising, leading to a growing need for efficient water management and conservation. In households and industrial settings, it is crucial to understand and monitor water usage patterns in order to reduce waste and conserve resources. Water usage tracking involves the collection and analysis of data on water usage, providing insights on usage patterns and trends. This information can be used to make informed decisions about water usage and to identify areas where improvements can be made.
In addition, water usage tracking can raise awareness about the importance of responsible water usage and encourage individuals and organizations to take action. Traditionally, water usage tracking has been a manual process, with users manually tracking their water usage and making estimates based on bills and other sources. However, with the development of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and data analysis, it is now possible to track water usage in real time and provide detailed and accurate information on usage patterns and trends. This project aims to develop a comprehensive and effective solution for water usage tracking, utilizing cutting-edge technologies to create a system that can accurately track and analyze water usage in real time. The system will provide insights on usage patterns and trends, and present the data in an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to make informed decisions about their water 
Usage.
